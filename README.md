# Library-Management-System

### Tools I've Used:
- Netbeans
- MySQL for the database.

### Front End and Back End
- Front End: Java Swing
- Back End: MySQL

### Drawbacks of Normal Library management
- Paper-based record keeping.
- Mis-management of data due to manual and paper-based handling.
- A vast amount of time consumption in searching for books and library management.
- Book-thefts from the library.

- Can logout

#### 2. Librarian
- Can add/view books
- Can issue books
- View issued books
- Return Books
- Can logout
